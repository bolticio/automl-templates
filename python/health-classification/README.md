# Python AutoML Templates

This folder contains Python-based AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) templates for various machine learning tasks. Each subfolder represents a different task or problem type, such as binary classification, regression, or clustering.

## Overview

AutoML is an approach that automates the process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. It aims to simplify the end-to-end workflow of data preparation, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation, making it more accessible to users without extensive machine learning expertise.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required Python packages specified in each subfolder's README.
2. Navigate to the subfolder corresponding to your machine learning task (e.g., tabular-binary-classification).
3. Follow the instructions in the subfolder's README to set up the environment, prepare the data, and run the AutoML pipeline.

### Folder Structure

- `health-classification`: Template for binary classification tasks on tabular data.

Each subfolder contains a Jupyter Notebook, sample data, and other necessary files to run the AutoML pipeline for the specific task.

### Customization

While these templates provide a good starting point, you may need to customize them to fit your specific use case. Some potential customizations include:

- Adjusting the data preprocessing steps
- Changing the evaluation metrics
- Modifying the AutoML settings
- Adding custom model interpretation or deployment steps

Feel free to modify the templates as needed and contribute your improvements back to the repository.
