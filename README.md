# AutoML Templates

This repository contains a collection of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) templates and examples implemented in various programming languages and frameworks. AutoML aims to automate the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems, making it more accessible to users without extensive machine learning expertise.

## Overview

AutoML techniques typically involve automating one or more of the following steps in the machine learning workflow:

1. Data Preparation: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, etc.
2. Feature Engineering: Automatically creating new features from the existing ones.
3. Model Selection: Searching for the best model architecture and algorithm for the given problem.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model's hyperparameters to improve performance.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics.
6. Model Deployment: Generating a serialized model artifact for inference or production deployment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder corresponding to your preferred programming language (e.g., python).
3. Each language folder contains subfolders for different machine learning tasks (e.g., tabular-binary-classification).
4. Follow the instructions in the respective subfolder's README to set up the environment, prepare the data, and run the scripts.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an AutoML template or example for a different programming language, machine learning task, or improvements to existing templates, please submit a pull request.

When contributing, please follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new subfolder for your contribution within the appropriate language folder.
2. Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the template.
3. Provide sample data or instructions on how to obtain the required data.
4. Document any dependencies or external libraries used.
5. Ensure that your code is well-commented and follows best practices.
